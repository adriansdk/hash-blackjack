### Installation

- Clone the [repository]('https://github.com/adriansdk/hash-blackjack.git')

- The app should automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`, if not, go to the url and have fun!

# Considerations

I worked on this game for around 4-5 hours, due to the time restrictions of the project there are A LOT of things I would've liked to do better, tried my best to keep things organized while focusing primarily on getting the main game to work, did a little bit of styling but nothing too fancy, definitely would've liked to have animations and more feedback to the user in the form of an ingame currency like "casino chips" and a gambling feature.
